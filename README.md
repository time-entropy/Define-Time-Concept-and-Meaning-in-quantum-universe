# Define Time Concept and Meaning in quantum universe model

## Time is the refresh of the universe's quantum bit network, where each refresh corresponds to a moment.

What Is Time? Defining Time Through the Lens of a Quantum Universe.

Imagine our universe as a three-dimensional "screen," where each pixel is a fundamental quantum of space—a Space elementary-elastic-energy Quantum (SEQ). Each moment in time corresponds to a refresh of this cosmic screen, with energy states reconfigured according to immutable physical laws. This framework redefines time not as an independent dimension but as a counting process of transformations in the spacetime network, governed by entropy and quantum constraints.

### 1. Time as a Sequence of Quantum Transformations

The Cosmic Screen Analogy:

If the universe is a dynamic 3D screen, its "pixels" (SEQs) encode energy states (integer multiples of Planck’s constant h). Each "refresh" represents a discrete transformation—akin to a frame update—where energy redistributes between pixels.

Example: Light bending around massive objects reflects energy conduction through SEQs, with the speed of light (c) as the maximum propagation rate.

Planck Time and Minimal Units:The smallest interval between transformations is Planck time (tₚ), the universe’s "frame rate." Each tₚ marks a non-reversible step toward higher entropy, aligning with the arrow of time.

### 2. Thermodynamics Drives the "Screen Refresh"

Energy Transfer Rules:

Energy flows from high-state to low-state SEQs, mirroring the second law of thermodynamics. This creates an irreversible homogenization of energy—a pixelated version of entropy increase.

Key Insight: Only a subset of possible energy configurations (transformations) actually occur, as entropy constraints prune paths toward equilibrium.

Non-Bijective Entropy Mapping: Multiple transformations may map to the same entropy value, but only one can manifest per tₚ. Thus, time’s flow is non-uniform, skipping "frames" that don’t increase entropy.

### 3. Implications for Motion and Causality

Nothing "Moves" in Empty Space:

Particles are excitations propagating through SEQs—like waves in a medium. The speed c is the medium’s maximum conduction rate, preventing velocity stacking beyond it.

## Time’s Arrow from Entropy:

Entropy Calculation in the Spacetime Quantum Bit Network per Refresh

During each refresh of the spacetime quantum bit network (SEQ network), the entropy is computed through a multiplicative operation on the energy states of all participating SEQs. The entropy value S for a closed system at a given moment is defined as: ​S = ∏ mᵢ, ᵢ∈ℕ

where mᵢ represents the energy norm of the i-th SEQ, quantized in integer multiples of Planck’s constant (ħ), expressed as mᵢ = nᵢħ with nᵢ ∈ ℕ.

The maximum entropy condition occurs when energy is uniformly distributed across all SEQs. This upper bound Sₘₐₓ is constrained by the average energy per SEQ (m̄):

Sₘₐₓ ≤m̅ᴺ; where m̄ = (1⁄N) ∑ mᵢ , ᵢ∈ℕ


The universe’s finite SEQs and their states limit possible configurations. Entropy selects which transformations "count" as time, making it emergent rather than fundamental.

### Conclusion: Time as Cosmic Pixel Art

Time, in this model, is the universe’s way of counting its own pixel updates—a thermodynamic filmstrip where entropy writes the script. By viewing reality as a quantum screen, we reconcile relativity, thermodynamics, and quantum mechanics into a unified narrative: Time is the ledger of spacetime’s energy ledger.

Further Reading:

Energy transfers between adjacent SEQs (i, j) are triggered only when a thermodynamic gradient exists, satisfying the condition:mᵢ > mⱼ + ħ

mᵢ → mᵢ − ħ; mⱼ → mⱼ + ħ

This process ensures that entropy increases monotonically, aligning with the second law of thermodynamics. The discrete nature of energy exchange (ħ-quantization) imposes a fundamental resolution limit on the system’s energy redistribution dynamics.

### The multiplicative entropy framework inherently links time’s arrow to irreversible state transitions, where each refresh corresponds to a stepwise entropy increase. Non-uniform energy distributions drive selective transformations, with higher-entropy configurations progressively dominating the network’s evolution.
